Generate secure download links dynamically from your uploads using shortcodes.

== Description ==

With the plugin WP DISPATCHER you can create an temporary and secure download link for your file uploads. Your uploads are secured in a special folder. The secure download links are created by shortcodes which you can use anywhere. Every shortcode call generates a new download link so be cautious where to use it (best suited within automatic emails).

- Create temporary download links for any file 
- Automatically expire download links after a time limit limit 
- Know how many times the file has been downloaded.

First upload your files to a secured folder. Then generate expiring links to your protected uploads. Usage with wp shortcodes. 

Caution: Files are protected via .htaccess. This works only in LAMP environment with Apache as Webserver.
